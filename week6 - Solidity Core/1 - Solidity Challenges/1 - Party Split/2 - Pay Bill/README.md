# Pay the Bill

Once the party's over, it's time to pay the shared expenses! Be sure to distribute the remainder to the members of the party 💸

## 🏁 Your Goal: Share Expenses

This challenge is all about creating a group with your friends to split a shared expense.

1. Create an external function called `payBill` which takes an address for the venue and an `uint` amount for the total cost of the bill.
   
2. Use the pooled funds in the contract to pay this bill amount to the venue address (you can assume the pooled funds from the deposit are enough to pay the bill).
   
3. In the `payBill` function, evenly distribute the remaining funds among the members of the party.
