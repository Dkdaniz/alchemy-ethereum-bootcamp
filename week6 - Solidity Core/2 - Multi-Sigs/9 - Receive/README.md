# Receive

A multi-sig can be used as a primary wallet for an organization. This organization will have all of its funds pooled and then vote on where to spend those funds.

They may direct all payments from external users/organizations to their multi-sig address. As such, it's important that the multi-sig can always receive funds! 💸
