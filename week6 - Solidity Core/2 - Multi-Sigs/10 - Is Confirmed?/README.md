# Check if Confirmed

Let's create a function that will help us determine if a transaction is confirmed or not!

We'll be able to use this as a quick lookup when executing the transaction. If the transaction is not confirmed, it should not be executed! 🔏

## 🏁 Your Goal: Confirmed Getter

1. Create a public view `isConfirmed` function with a uint transaction ID as it's only argument.
   
2. This function should return `true` if the transaction is confirmed and `false` if it is not.
   
> 💡 You have written a helper function that may help you out here!

## 🧪 Run Test

Access this path in your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
yarn test
```

or

```bash
yarn mocha ./src/test.js
```
