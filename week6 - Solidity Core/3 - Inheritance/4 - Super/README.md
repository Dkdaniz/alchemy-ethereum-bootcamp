# Super Call

In the last stage we wrote an override function for an unimplemented function on the base contract.

In other cases, the base contract will have functionality in its `virtual` functions that we want to share with our derived contracts. That's when it's time to use `super`.

```solidity
contract Base {
	uint public value = 10;

	function modify() virtual external {
		value *= 2;
	}
}

contract Derived is Base {
	function modify() virtual override external {
		value += 20;
        super.modify(); // results in value = 60
        // Base.modify() would also work!
	}
}
```

‚òùÔ∏è You can see in our `Derived` contract we are modifying the value and then calling `super.modify` to invoke the function on the base contract as well. This will first perform `value += 20` from the override function, then perform `value *= 2` from the `super` function, resulting in `value=60`.

With arguments this works like any other function: we would pass through arguments to `super.modify()`.

## üèÅ Your Goal: Add the Super!

The `attack` function is now implemented by the Hero base contract. It will decrement energy from our hero after every attack.

Let's invoke this base contract function from within the `attack` function for both (derived) hero contracts: Mage and Warrior.
