# Base Utility Contracts

It is often quite useful for a base contract to provide utility functions and modifiers.

Let's see an example:

```solidity
contract Depositable {
    modifier requiresDeposit {
        require(msg.value >= 1 ether);
        _;
    }
}

contract Escrow is Depositable {
    address owner;
    constructor() requiresDeposit {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
}
```

☝️ Here the `Escrow` contract requires a deposit of at least 1 ether in order to deploy. Otherwise the transaction will revert.

This requirement comes from the base contract `Depositable` and is used through the inherited `requiresDeposit` modifier.

## 🏁 Your Goal: Only Owner

On the `Collectible.sol` tab you'll see that `Collectible` contract inherits from the `Ownable` contract.

1. Your goal is to fill out the `Ownable` base contract, which will be used by the `Collectible` contract!
2. The `owner` should be defined in the `Ownable` base contract
3. Ensure that `markPrice` can only be called by the `owner` (the deployer of the collectible)

> 💡 HINT: The `markPrice` function uses an `onlyOwner` modifier which is currently not implemented anywhere!

## 🧪 Run Test
