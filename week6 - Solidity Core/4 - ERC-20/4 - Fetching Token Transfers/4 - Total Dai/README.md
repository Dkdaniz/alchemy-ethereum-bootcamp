# Get Logs

Ok, now it's time to use the `eth_getLogs` endpoint! This method is part of the Ethereum JSON-RPC API standard. It allows clients to retrieve a list of log entries that match a specified set of filter criteria. In the last two stages we have set our filter criteria by building the first two topics!

When a smart contract emits an event, it generates a log entry that contains information about the event. The `eth_getLogs` endpoint allows clients to retrieve a list of these log entries! The request params are essentially a filter object that specifies the criteria for the log entries to be retrieved. The filter object can include fields such as contract address, topics, fromBlock, and toBlock, among others ([see the full documentation here](https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/eth-getlogs)).

This `eth_getLogs` endpoint can be useful for developers and users who want to analyze the data generated by smart contracts and track specific events of interest. In our example we are filtering on the `Transfer` event, but we could be filtering for any type of event with any of the indexed parameters!

When you retrieve the logs from the `eth_getLogs` endpoint, each log will have a data property which is a string that contains the concatenated values of all non-indexed arguments. Each non-indexed argument is padded to 32 bytes, similar to what we did with the second topic! In the case of the `Transfer` event, there is only one non-indexed value.

## 🏁 Your Goal: Total Dai Transferred

Let's get all the dai transferred from the account we padded in stage two, between the `fromBlock` and the `toBlock` using the `eth_getLogs` method through the [Alchemy SDK](https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/alchemy-sdk-quickstart!)

Take a look at [the eth_getLogs documentation](https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/eth-getlogs) to learn what the names of the parameters are to provide them to the `params` object. Then, you'll need to take a look at the response to return the sum of all the dai transfered across all of the logs. Let's break this out into steps:

1. The `toBlock`, `fromBlock`, and `topics` (which you manually encoded!) are all already provided to the params. You'll just need to add the `address` for the contract we're looking for events on, which is the dai contract: `0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f`
2. Find which property in each log holds the total amount of dai transferred by looking at the eth_getLogs documentation or inspecting the response with `console.log`.
3. Sum up all of the dai transferred across all the logs and return it. You will need to use BigInt here because we're going to be working with very large numbers. You can find the [BigInt documentation on MDN](https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/eth-getlogs).
4. Return the sum of all the dai transferred.

> 🧐 Hint: When you're looking for the amount of dai transferred in each log, it's important to note that the property   is going to all of the non-indexed parameters in the event. And remember the transfer event signature is event `Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)`.
