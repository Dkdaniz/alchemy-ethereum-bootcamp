# Indexed Topics

In the last stage you may have noticed the word "indexed" in the event signature:

```solidity
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
```

When a topic is marked as "indexed", it means that the Ethereum Virtual Machine will hash the topic's value before storing it in the log entry. This allows the Ethereum client software to efficiently search for log entries based on the values of indexed topics.

Indexed topics can be used to filter and sort log entries based on specific criteria, such as the address of the sender, the type of event that occurred, or other important information. This makes it easier for developers and users to analyze the data generated by smart contracts and to identify specific events of interest.

When it comes to topics, the first topic is the event signature. The second, third and fourth topics (there's a max of 4 topics) are each indexed parameter in the order they are defined.

## 🏁 Your Goal: Indexed From

Let's focus on `TODO #2` and fill out the `secondTopic` function! For our second topic, we're going to specify the _from address in the Transfer event. This way, we can filter on who sent the token.

To do this, we'll need to take an address and pad it out to 32 bytes. The address we're going to use is a super active one on mainnet.

1. Copy the following address: `0x28c6c06298d514db089934071355e5743bf21d60`
2. Paste it into a string in the secondTopic function.
3. Strip the leading 0x out of the address.
4. Pad this address out to 32 bytes by adding zeroes in front of the address.

> 📖 Remember that an address is 20 bytes, which is 40 hexadecimal characters. We'll want to pad this out with zeroes until it is 32 bytes, which is 64 hexadecimal characters.
