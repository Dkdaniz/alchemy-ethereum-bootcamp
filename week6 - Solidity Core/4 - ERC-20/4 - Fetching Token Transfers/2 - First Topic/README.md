# Topics

In the upcoming stages, we'll use the `eth_getLogs` JSON RPC endpoint ([docs here](https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/eth-getlogs)) to retrieve the logs related to the Dai contract. We'll use this determine the total amount of DAI transferred by a particular address. Before we get there we need to talk about topics! Topics are used to categorize the logs to search for specific events! But, what are topics, exactly?

Topics are 32-byte hash values that represent a specific piece of information related to the event being logged. For example, if a smart contract logs an event every time a user makes a purchase, one topic might represent the user's address, while another topic might represent the product that was purchased.

Topics are used to filter and sort log entries, which makes it easier for developers and users to analyze the data generated by smart contracts.

## 🏁 Your Goal: Our First Topic

If we want to filter for `Transfer` events, we'll need to provide `eth_getLogs` with the topic to search for. The first topic is the event signature. We'll need to take the `Transfer` event, strip all of the keywords, spaces and argument names, and finally keccak hash it to get the topic representing the transfer event.

You can find the standard Transfer event [here](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20#events), which is defined as:

```solidity
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
```

Your goal is to complete `TODO #1`:

1. Take the above `Transfer` event signature, strip the keywords (`event`, `indexed` but not the types!), spaces and argument names.
2. Put the resulting stripped down signature in the `eventSignature` variable.

> 💭 Hint: For a similar example, a stripped down purchase signature might look like this: `Purchased(address,uint256)`. Notice there are no spaces! Parenthesis and commas are preserved.

That's it! This method is setup to keccak hash the signature for you, so the topic will be made available to our `eth_getLogs` call which we'll work on in a future stage!

> 🧐 Hopefully this process of hashing the signature should feel a bit familiar! This is similar to how we target function signatures on smart contracts, by hashing the function signature and adding the first 4 bytes to the calldata of the transaction!
