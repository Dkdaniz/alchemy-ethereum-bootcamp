# Base Functions

We can create functions which serve a basic purpose and then re-use them in other library functions.

In this way we make it easier to **`DRY`** up our code.

> 📖 As metioned in an earlier JavaScript lesson **`DRY`** stands for **`Don't Repeat Yourself`**, it's a great sofware practice and a huge motivation behind libraries.

## 🏁 Your Goal: Find the Secret!

There is a **`secret unsigned integer`** that will pass this stage. Your goal is to find what that secret is! 🔑

You can do so by logging the message passed to the constructor. Follow the message's instructions to pass the stage!

> 📖 You'll notice the keyword **`memory`** on the string argument. This is the string's "data location". We talked about this concept in the Week 5 Reference Types section.
