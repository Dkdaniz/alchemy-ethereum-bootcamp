# How to Deploy an Upgradeable Vending Machine Smart Contract

In this guide, we will run through deploying smart contracts that use the transparent proxy pattern in order to be upgradeable. Deploying your contracts under a proxy can be useful in order to future-proof your smart contract functionality. You will be able to deploy a version 1 contract, add new functionality and then deploy a version 2 of that contract under the proxy, and so on...

The above diagram we looked at in the previous section is the same one we will replicate in this activity. ‚¨ÜÔ∏è

## Why Are We Upgrading a Vending Machine?! ü§ñ

We know the example might seem simplistic, but for learning purposes this actually works pretty great... think about it: a real life vending machine has certain abilities... it can:

- dispense a drink if the user inputs the coins/cash required
- typically vending machines hold drinks, but they can also hold snacks
- some vending machines accept credit cards, which is a nice feature for users
- some vending machines provide cold drinks, some don't
  
These are just typical features of a vending machine! Right. But put yourself in the shoes of a vending machine's owner for a minute... you have to consider so many things:

- What drinks/snacks sell the best?
- What price points are the right balance between profit and customer satisfaction?
- Should I optimize for more drinks, more snacks, only drinks, only snacks? What are the space tradeoffs of each one?
- How much real estate do I even have to set this vending machine? And how much will rent cost?
- How many people even pass by the machine every day?
- etc, etc, etc
  
As you can see, for something as simple as a vending machine, these decisions are quite tough to make! Similarly, when deploying a dApp, developers can be faced with many similar decisions!

Luckily, upgradeable smart contracts give them flexibility to choose a more iterative approach to solving these problems - rather then going with a solution set in stone forever. üóø The above are all planned considerations... but what about unplanned or as us developers call them **`bugs`**? Let's run through some hypothetical ones, still using the vending machine example:

- The machine was set up with a mechanical issue that prevents sodas from being dispensed.
- The machine coin slot is left unlocked accidentally.
- The soda brand being advertised on the machine goes out of business.
- The city council builds a new pedestrian road around where your machine is placed, now no one passes by it.
- One of the buttons was pressed so hard by someone that it jammed.

We didn't even mention the case where you as a business owner just want to... well... **`upgrade`**!

Your machine is doing so well, you need to set up a new bigger one that can handle a larger flow of people more efficiently.
Your machine is doing so well, you add new soda brands.
In order to reward your users, you've set up a loyalty points system.
Your machine was initially set up to only accept coins, you have now upgraded it to accept coins, cash, bitcoin, ether and credit cards - giving it access to whole new markets of users (ayooo!).
All right, all right.. you get the point!

Just like in real life you need flexibility to account for bugs, issues and iterative upgrades, smart contract upgradeability gives you that flexibility and we will get to see this first hand via deploying an upgradeable vending machine smart contract.

## Guide Requirements

In this guide, we will use the following packages/plugins:

[OpenZeppelin Upgradeable Package](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/upgradeable)
[OpenZeppelin Hardhat Upgrades plugin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/upgradeable)

## Step 1: Set Up Hardhat Project Structure

### Install Dependencies

1. In a folder of your choice, `run mkdir my-upgradeable-contract && cd my-upgradeable-contract`
2. Run `npm init -y`
3. Run `npm install --save-dev hardhat`
4. Run `npm install @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle @openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable @openzeppelin/hardhat-upgrades`
5. We will be verifying our contract on Etherscan! Run `npm install @nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan@3.0.1`
6. We will be using `dotenv` to keep our project-wide environment variables safe and accessible! Run `npm install dotenv`
7. Run` npx hardhat` to initiate the Hardhat development environment. This will bring up some yes/no options, press `Enter` to select 'Create a JavaScript project'

<img src="../../../../img/../Pessoal/alchemy-ethereum-bootcamp/img/upgradeable1.png">

8. Press `Enter` to select yes to all of the options
9. You should now have a full sample Hardhat repo in your `my-upgradeable-contract` folder

### Delete Hardhat Sample Project Material

Now let's delete some of the example stuff that we don't need!

1. In the `/contracts` folder, delete `Lock.sol`
2. In the `/scripts` folder, delete `deploy.js`
3. In the `/test` folder, delete `Lock.js`
   
### Set up `.env` File & Variables

In the root of your Hardhat project, create a new file called `.env`
Open that file and copy-paste the following:

```
ALCHEMY_GOERLI_URL=
GOERLI_PRIVATE_KEY=
ETHERSCAN_KEY=
```
You will need to populate the variables with:

1. An HTTPS URL containing your Alchemy API KEY, retrieved from your Alchemy Dashboard.

> Make sure it's from an app on the G√∂erli test network! üëÄ

2. Your G√∂erli private key, exported from a wallet like Apex or MetaMask.

> If you need testnet funds, use the [Alchemy testnet faucet.](https://goerlifaucet.com/)

3. An Etherscan API Key. These are pretty easy to get. Just register for an account at [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/).
   
Make sure to save and close the file once you populate all the variables! Some important things to keep in mind:

- This file contains extremely sensitive data... did you make sure `.env` is included in your project's `.gitignore`?
- Remember that even though your private key is to control testnet funds for this activity, it is the same exact private key that controls any mainnet funds you have on the account! **`ONLY USE AN ACCOUNT FIT FOR TESTING!`**
- Did you take the time to name your wallet something that indicates it is for testing only?
- Do you fully understand why the `dotenv` library is so important to a smart contract developer?
  
### Add Important Configuartions to `hardhat.config.js`

Ok! We're almost there. We just need to add a couple of important things to the `hardhat.config.js` file:

1. Open the `hardhat.config.js` in your project root
2. Overwrite the entire file that Hardhat included as part of the sample project, and copy-paste the following contents:
   
```javascript
require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle");
require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan");
require('@openzeppelin/hardhat-upgrades');
require("dotenv").config();

module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.17",
  networks: {
    goerli: {
      url: process.env.ALCHEMY_GOERLI_URL,
      accounts: [process.env.GOERLI_PRIVATE_KEY]
    }
  },
  etherscan: {
    apiKey: process.env.ETHERSCAN_KEY
  }
};
```

Almost there! We are done setting up the `hardhat.config.js`, go ahead and save/close it.

We are done with project setup - nice! üí• Let the fun begin! üé∏üî•

### Step 2: Add Smart Contracts

Just for learning, we will be looking to upgrade a `VendingMachineV1.sol` contract to a `VendingMachineV2.sol `contract. The goal is to preserve the original `VendingMachineV1.sol` state while also being able to add new functionality via `VendingMachineV2`, `VendingMachineV3`, etc.

#### Add Code Files

1. In your `/contracts` folder, run touch V`endingMachineV1.sol`
2. Open the `VendingMachine.sol` file and copy-paste the following contents:
   
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.17;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol";

contract VendingMachineV1 is Initializable {
  // these state variables and their values
  // will be preserved forever, regardless of upgrading
  uint public numSodas;
  address public owner;

  function initialize(uint _numSodas) public initializer {
    numSodas = _numSodas;
    owner = msg.sender;
  }

  function purchaseSoda() public payable {
    require(msg.value >= 1000 wei, "You must pay 1000 wei for a soda!");
    numSodas--;
  }
}
```

You'll notice a couple of things have changed from the typical contracts we write here at AU:

- The contract inherits from `Initializable`, imported from the [@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/upgradeable) package
- The contract no longer has a `constructor`! Instead it is replaced with an `initialize()` along with the `initializer` modifier, which is also inherited from the same OZ package.

> No constructor?! This is an upgradeable smart contract and so it is written a little different. [Read more about writing upgradeable smart contracts.](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/writing-upgradeable) üëÄ

**This is our V1 contract**. Pretty simple right? In it, we have:

- a `public` state variable: `uint numSodas`
- a `public` state variable: `address owner`
- **one** `function` called `purchaseSoda()` that requires a user send `1000 wei` in order to "purchase a soda" which for now just deducts 1 from the `numSodas` state variable

At surface level, this seems like a great little vending machine contract and we are excited to deploy it to the test network! ‚ò∫Ô∏è

> Hint: This contract might have a bug! ü¶ü Can you spot what it is already? üí∏

#### Step 3: Write a Deploy Script to Deploy VendingMachineV1

We will deploy our contract slightly different than we usually do...

1. In your `/scripts` folder, run `touch deployProxy.js`
2. Open the `deployProxy.js` file and copy-paste the following contents:
   
```javascript
const { ethers, upgrades } = require('hardhat');

async function main() {
  const VendingMachineV1 = await ethers.getContractFactory('VendingMachineV1');
  const proxy = await upgrades.deployProxy(VendingMachineV1, [100]);
  await proxy.deployed();

  const implementationAddress = await upgrades.erc1967.getImplementationAddress(
    proxy.address
  );

  console.log('Proxy contract address: ' + proxy.address);

  console.log('Implementation contract address: ' + implementationAddress);
}

main();
```

Notice the command used is `deployProxy()`. It takes the arguments passed into the `VendingMachineV1`'s `initialize()` function in array format.

We are deploying our `VendingMachineV1` with the `numSodas` state variable set to `100`. Feel free to set it to whatever you like!

3. Save the file.
4. You are now ready to deploy `VendingMachineV1`!
   
#### Step 4: Deploy (and Verify) your Contracts!

##### Run Deploy Script

1. In your project root folder, run `npx hardhat run scripts/deployProxy.js --network goerli`
2. After a few seconds, your terminal console will display both the deployed Proxy contract address AND the Implementation contract address
   
> Keep both of these addresses handy! You'll need em for the next step :)

3. Go to [G√∂erli Etherscan](https://goerli.etherscan.io/) and copy-paste your V1 Implementation address into the search bar
   
At this point, the Implementation contract may actually already be verified! The reason is Etherscan has already verified that exact same contract bytecode and will show any previously verified contracts accordingly. Don't worry if it already is, you can still run through confirming verification and you will still verify any future upgrades as well!

If it is not yet verified, Etherscan will only show the contract bytecode which means our proxy address will not be able to use the Etherscan's `Read as Proxy` and `Write as Proxy` functionality! We definitely want to be able to do this. And we want to be able to see the code inside our original implementation contract too!

##### Verify Contract on Etherscan
Copy the implementation address, go to your terminal and run the following command:
```
npx hardhat verify --network goerli YOUR_VENDINGMACHINEV1_IMPLEMENTATION_ADDRESS
```

> Note! Do NOT verify your deployed Proxy address, you want to verify the VendingMachineV1!

This command will compile your contract and send the bytecode to Etherscan, Etherscan will verify it and your contract code should now be readable! ‚úÖ

#### Step 5: Interact With `VendingMachineV1` via its Proxy contract!

Thanks to [EIP-1967](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1967), we can interact with our `VendingMachineV1` Implementation contract directly via our Proxy contract!

**`We can do this in a script any time`**, but since we have verified the BoxV1 contract, let's read/write it using Etherscan just for fun (and also, this is functionality used by many web3 users!).

1. From you terminal, copy your Proxy contract address
2. Paste it into [G√∂erli Etherscan](https://goerli.etherscan.io/)
3. Select the 'Contract' tab
4. On the right-hand side, select 'More Options'
5. Select 'Is this a proxy?'
6. Select 'Verify'
7. Select 'Save'
8. Now, go back to your Proxy contract's Etherscan page
   
You will now see the following new options appear on the tabs:

<img src="../../../../img/../Pessoal/alchemy-ethereum-bootcamp/img/upgradeable2.png">

You can now `Read as Proxy` and `Write as Proxy`, exactly as we initially intended! üëè

If you've done everything correctly up until this point, reading the contract as the proxy should just give you one option: `numSodas` and its state should be equal to `100`.

#### Step 6: Upgrade Proxy to `VendingMachineV2`

Guess what? Our V1 machine works pretty great for a basic vending machine... but, it has one major issue:

- There's no `withdrawProfits()` function! Ahhhh!! We've basically created a one-way sink for ether and that's really bad. It's ok, we made our contract upgradeable so we can iterate a fix for this: add in a `withdraw() `function that is admin-protected.
  
Here's a suggestion or two of what you can add to a further V3 Vending Machine, but there is soooo much more:

- a `mapping` that keeps track of how many sodas a user has purchased (this can lay the ground for future upgraded functionality such as loyalty points)
- there is literally NO check on the purchaseSoda() function to make sure `numSodas` is not <= 0. How would we fix this? Also, there. is no way to add new sodas to the machine!

If we hadn't made this contract upgradeable, we'd have to deploy a whole new contract just do this, and we'd lose all of our transaction and storage history! At production scale, that can be pretty bad!

##### Add `VendingMachineV2.sol` File

In your project, go to your `/contracts` folder and run `touch VendingMachineV2.sol`
Open the `VendingMachineV2.sol` file and copy-paste the following contents:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.17;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol";

contract VendingMachineV2 is Initializable {
  // these state variables and their values
  // will be preserved forever, regardless of upgrading
  uint public numSodas;
  address public owner;

  function initialize(uint _numSodas) public initializer {
    numSodas = _numSodas;
    owner = msg.sender;
  }

  function purchaseSoda() public payable {
    require(msg.value >= 1000 wei, "You must pay 1000 wei for a soda!");
    numSodas--;
    // challenge: add a mapping to keep track of user soda purchases!
  }

  function withdrawProfits() public onlyOwner {
    require(address(this).balance > 0, "Profits must be greater than 0 in order to withdraw!");
    (bool sent, ) = owner.call{value: address(this).balance}("");
    require(sent, "Failed to send ether");
  }

  function setNewOwner(address _newOwner) public onlyOwner {
    owner = _newOwner;
  }

  modifier onlyOwner() {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can call this function.");
    _;
  }
}
```

In our **V2** upgrade above, we have added:

- a new modifier: `onlyOwner` to use in order to admin-protect function
two new functions:
`withdrawProfits()`: allows for the contract owner to withdraw vending machine profits
- `setOwner`: allows the current contract owner to set a new owner for the vending machine
  
##### Add Special Upgrade Script

We will also need a special script to perform the upgrade on the existing proxy contract which now points to VendingMachineV1.

1. In your /scripts folder, run touch upgradeProxy.js
2. Open the upgradeProxy.js file and copy-paste the following contents:
   
```javascript
const { ethers, upgrades } = require('hardhat');

// TO DO: Place the address of your proxy here!
const proxyAddress = '';

async function main() {
  const VendingMachineV2 = await ethers.getContractFactory('VendingMachineV2');
  const upgraded = await upgrades.upgradeProxy(proxyAddress, VendingMachineV2);

  const implementationAddress = await upgrades.erc1967.getImplementationAddress(
    proxyAddress
  );

  console.log("The current contract owner is: " + upgraded.owner());
  console.log('Implementation contract address: ' + implementationAddress);
}

main();
```

> Make sure to copy-paste the Proxy contract address (which currently points to `VendingMachineV1`) into the above script!

You are now ready to upgrade your contract! What the script does is basically change the current Proxy pointer to a newly deployed `VendingMachineV2`!

3. In your project root, run `npx hardhat run scripts/upgradeProxy.js --network goerli`
While we are here, let's go ahead and verify VendingMachineV2. Get the implementation contract address from the terminal output of your upgrade script!

4. Verify the `VendingMachineV2` contract by running npx hardhat verify --network goerli `VendingMachineV2_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`
You should now be able to interact with your VERSION 2 upgrades directly from your Proxy contract on Etherscan as we did in the last step!

Should you need to upgrade the V2 contract, you would just do the same steps but with a V3 contract and so on...

**`Happy upgrading!`** üèó
