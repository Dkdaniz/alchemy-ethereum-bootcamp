# Single Vote

## 🏁 Your Goal: Vote Once

1. Each address should only be allowed to call `createVote` **`once`**.
2. If they try again, **`the transaction should be reverted`**. 🔒

> 💡 Remember that **`external`** functions can be changed to **`public`** if you'd like to use them internally as well! 🙂

## 🧪 Run Test
Access this path in your terminal and run the following command:
