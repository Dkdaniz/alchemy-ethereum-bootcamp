## Instructions

Today, we will be cloning down some fun smart contract puzzles. In these challenges, you will need to analyze the source code and somehow trigger a `win` condition. 🏆

The objective is to set this `isWon` to true without modifying the smart contract.

You will need to analyze the source code of five simplified smart contracts and determine how to solve a puzzle for each one. **`Once you've figured out the puzzle, modify the test cases to complete the task successfully. ⏬`**

The way to solve these challenges is: **`do it using the relevant contract's test file!`** So if you are solving `Game1.sol`, the way to do it is to:

1. edit the game1Test.js file
2. leave the Game1.sol contract intact
3. run npx hardhat test test/game1Test.js
   
> You can run all the test `files` in the test folder by running `npx hardhat test` 🏎

## Set Up Project Locally

1. In a directory of your choice, run `git clone https://github.com/ChainShot/Contract-Puzzles`
2. Remember to `cd` into this newly-cloned directory!
3. Run `npm install`
   
> Helpful Hint: `git clone https://github.com/ChainShot/Contract-Puzzles .` will clone the repo into the current directory, instead of creating a child directory. ⚡️

4. Read the [README.md](https://github.com/ChainShot/Contract-Puzzles/blob/master/readme.md)

5. Once you are able to `run npx hardhat test` and get all the tests passing green with ✅✅✅✅✅ check marks, you have successfully solved all the challenges! 🧠

Some of these are simple... some of these can be a little tougher! 😈 The contracts use mappings as a base component in order to solidify your understanding. Buckle up, you got this!! 💪
