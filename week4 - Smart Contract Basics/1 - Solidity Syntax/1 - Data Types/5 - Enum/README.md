# Enum Type

The Enum Type helps us write clean code! 🚿

Consider this example:

```js
if(player.movement == 0) {
    // player is moving up
}
else if(player.movement == 1) {
    // player is moving left
}
```

☝️ Those comments are helpful, but they aren't exactly a **`foolproof`** plan! The movement number is being generated somewhere else in the code. If that ever changed, it would break our code! 🐛

Plus, without the comments, there would be no way to tell which direction is which! 😱

An enum can clean this up! Let's see:

```js
enum Directions = { Up, Left, Down, Right }
if(player.movement == Directions.Up) {

}
else if(player.movement == Directions.Left) {
    
}
```

😌 Much cleaner! 🧘

Not only are the numbers replaced with clear directions, we also have a structure for defining all our directions. We can share this structure, `Directions`, with other contracts to ensure that if the numbers change they won't break the rest of the code!

> 📖 Underneath the hood, enum values are stored as unsigned integers. If there are less than 256 values, it will be stored as a `uint8`. If you have more than 256 values it will use a `uint16` and will grow from there as needed (although I'm not sure how many contracts will ever need more than **`65536 values`** in their enum...). The way this data is stored will become more important when we look to parse our smart contracts from the outside world through the ABI.

## 🏁 Your Goal: Make Some Food!

In the `enum` provided you'll see there are four types of `Foods`! 🍎🍌🍕🥯

Take the values and store them in `food1`, `food2`, `food3`, and `food4`!

> 🎨 Feel free to pick your own favorite foods and add them to the list and food values as well!
