# Hardhat Quick Guide: Modifying State Variables

In this guide, we will set up a simple Hardhat project structure, add a contract with a state variable and a function to modify it. We will then write a quick test to make sure the function modifies the state variable as expected - let's get to it!

> Hardhat is one of the ultimate web3 development tools. ðŸ”¥ We are creating guides like this in order for you to get some practice using it! Master Hardhat, master web3 development! ðŸ”¨

## Step 1: Set Up Project Structure Using Hardhat

1. In a folder of your choice, run `mkdir modify-contract-state && cd modify-contract-state`
2. Run `npm init -y`
3. Run `npm install --save-dev hardhat`
4. Run `npm install @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox chai @nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan ethers`
5. Run `npx hardhat` to initiate the Hardhat development environment - it will bring up some yes/no options, use the arrow keys to toggle the options and select` Create an empty hardhat.config.js`

6. Your project directory should now contain the following: `node modules`,` package.json`, `package-lock.json` and the empty `hardhat.config.js` you just created - rolling on!
7. Open your project's `hardhat.config.js`, delete all of its contents and copy-paste the following:

```js
require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers");

module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.4",
};
```

**Make sure that the solidity compiler version in your project's `hardhat-config.js` is set to` 0.8.4` so that it matches that of the following contract!**

## Step 2: Create Smart Contract

1. From your project root directory, run cd contracts
2. Run touch ModifyVariable.sol (creates a new file called ModifyVariable.sol in the current directory) and open the newly-created contract file
3. Copy-paste the following:

```solidity
//SPDX-License-Identifier: Unlicense
pragma solidity ^0.8.4;

contract ModifyVariable {
  uint public x;

  constructor(uint _x) {
    x = _x;
  }

  function modifyToLeet() public {
    x = 1337;
  }
}
```
We've implemented a very simple smart contract that contains one state variable `x` and a function `modifyToLeet` that, when called, changes the state of the variable to be `1337`.

4. Go ahead and save your contract - feel free to add more functions!

## Step 3: Create Test

1. Make sure to go back to your project root directory by `cd` back from the `contracts` directory
2. In your project root, run `mkdir test` to create a new `/test` directory that will contain all your testing files!
3. In the `/test` directory, create a file called `sample-test.js` and copy-paste the following into it:

```solidity
// import testing libraries: https://www.chaijs.com/guide/styles/ 
const { expect, assert } = require("chai");

// the `describe` scope encapsulates an entire test called `TestModifyVariable`
// the `it` says the behavior that should be expected from the test
describe("TestModifyVariable", function () {
  it("should change x to 1337", async function () {
    // this line creates an ethers ContractFactory abstraction: https://docs.ethers.org/v5/api/contract/contract-factory/
    const ModifyVariable = await ethers.getContractFactory("ModifyVariable");

    // we then use the ContractFactory object to deploy an instance of the contract
    const contract = await ModifyVariable.deploy(10);

    // wait for contract to be deployed and validated!
    await contract.deployed();

    // modify x from 10 to 1337 via this function!
    await contract.modifyToLeet();
    // getter for state variable x
    const newX = await contract.x();
    assert.equal(newX.toNumber(), 1337);
  });
});
```
This test, when executed, will deploy a contract instance contract and set x (that instance's state variable) to 10. It then calls the modifyToLeet() function on the instance which prompts a change to the state variable to 1337 and then uses assert.equal() to verify the change was successful.

4. Go ahead and save the file - feel free to play around with the values and add more tests!

## Step 4: Run the Test

1. In your project root folder, run npx hardhat test
> If you are still in /test in your terminal, just type in cd .. and that will push your directory one back! :)

2. Your terminal output should look something like this:

You have successfully set up a whole project structure! With the help of Hardhat, you were able to test whether your functions modifying your smart contract's state variables were actually modified - nice job!

## Extra Challenges:

[x] Create a new type string state variable and modify it
[x] Change the constructor argument
[x] Add a new test
[x] Create a scripts directory, deploy your contract and change the contract state

## ðŸ§ª Run Test

Access this path in your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
yarn test
```
or

```bash
yarn hardhat test ./test/ModifyVariable.js
```
