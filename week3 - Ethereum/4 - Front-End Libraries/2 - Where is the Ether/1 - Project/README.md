# Where is the Ether?

If you take a look at the test cases you'll see that there will be three blocks mined with several transactions in each one.

The addresses where the ether is sent to will be randomly generated. It is up to you to find all of these addresses and return them in an array.

## 🏁 Your Goal: Find the Addresses

The `findEther` function is passed an `address` which has sent ether to several addresses. The goal of this function is to find every address that has received ether and return it in an array of addresses.

## 🧪 Run Test
