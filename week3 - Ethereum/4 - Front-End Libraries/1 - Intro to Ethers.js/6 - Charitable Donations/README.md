# Donating to Charities

Final Stage! This one is a bit of a challenge. 🧗

It's time to take everything you've learned and put it all together. 🧠

## 🏁 Your Goal: Complete the function donate

The function `donate` will take a private key and an array of charity addresses as it's two arguments.

The private key corresponds to an address pre-loaded with 10 ETH. 🔑💰

You will need to donate **`at least one ether`** to each of the charities in the array.

## 🧪 Run Test

Access this path in your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
yarn test
```

or

```bash
yarn mocha ./src/test.js
```
