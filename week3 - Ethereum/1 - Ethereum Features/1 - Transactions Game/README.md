# Transactions Game

## Activity Requirements

[Apex Wallet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/apex-wallet/oppceojapmdmhpnmjpballbbdclocdhj): Browser extension wallet that provides key storage and secure account login, allows you to send transactions, and acts as a JSON-RPC gateway. We‚Äôll be using Apex in these instructions but free to use any browser based wallet for this activity.

[Alchemy University Discord](https://discord.com/invite/alchemy-university): Community of thousands of students learning web3 development together. We‚Äôll be using the AU discord to make friends and send test Ether to for this activity!

## Setup

## 1. Install the [Apex Wallet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/apex-wallet/oppceojapmdmhpnmjpballbbdclocdhj)

For this activity we‚Äôll use our wallet to connect to a test network on Ethereum. If you haven‚Äôt already installed a wallet, you can install the Apex wallet for free by following [these instructions](https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/how-to-create-an-apex-wallet). Remember to **`write down`** your seed phrase!

> We love Apex! Why? [Here is an article on why we prefer this wallet](https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/why-use-apex-wallet?a=dkdaniz). üëÄ

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **`Recommendation`** It is best practice to separate out your ‚Äútesting‚Äù wallet used in development from your actual wallet that stores real funds. For this reason, we recommend either of the following options:

### **1. Create a separate browser account for your test wallet**

- **Example**: If you use google chrome, create a new chrome account and install the testing wallet on that new account so it stays separate from your actual funds

### **2. Use a separate browser than the one you normally use for your web3 wallet and download a new wallet extension there**

- **Example**: if you normally use Brave Browser, download Chrome and create a test wallet there

## 2. Toggle to Goerli Test Network

Once you have Apex installed, let's make sure to select the correct test network: Goerli - if you have experience with test networks, this might seem redundant but it is especially important to note that `Ethereum Mainnet` as the chosen network means it is real money at play - always make sure you are in a proper testing environment!

## 3. Acquire Goerli ETH

Visit https://goerlifaucet.com/ and enter your wallet address to receive test ETH.

> ‚úÖ PRO Tip: Login with your Alchemy account to unlock even more test ETH.

## 4. How to send a transaction

In your wallet, now toggled to Goerli Test Network...

1. Select 'Send'
2. In the 'Add Recipient' field, copy-paste the public key of the group member you want to tip
3. Fill in .1 in the 'Amount' field
4. Select 'Next'
5. Select 'Next'
6. View the transaction on [etherscan](https://goerli.etherscan.io/!

You should see the transaction quickly mined. Goerli is meant to emulate the Ethereum mainnet as closely as possible so you will even be able to see the transaction being mined on https://goerli.etherscan.io/ - just plug in the transaction hash or click on the link directly from your wallet!

# Game Description

In this activity, we'll be creating a tipping economy within Alchemy University Discord! The goal of this game is for us to get practice sending transactions via our wallets.

Now that you know how to use a browser wallet to send transactions (step #5 of the previous section!) AND you've funded your wallet with some testnet G√∂erli ETH, let's actually start sending some testnet ETH to some of the folks in the AU Discord!

## Instructions

1. In this [AU Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/1039895401832128532/1050240006574317618), copy-paste:

- a cool fun fact about yourself (don't hold back!!)
- your wallet's Ethereum public address

Like this:

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;width: 50%;" src="../../img/ethereumFeaturesDiscord.png">

1. Scroll through this channel to see some of the other fun facts + addresses posted by fellow AU colleagues.

2. If you see a fun fact that you like or resonates with you, send that person some G√∂erli ETH! (and send them a friend request!)

Let's create an AU tipping economy on the G√∂erli Test Network!!!!

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Please make sure your wallet is set to the G√∂erli Test Network, NOT mainnet.

Once you have successfully sent one of your AU frens some testnet ETH, mark this activity as completed. Welcome to the AU tipping economy!
