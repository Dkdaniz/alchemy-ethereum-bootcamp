# Blockchain Time

We have a new file: `Blockchain.js`. How exciting! 😁

This stage is going to focus on adding the first block to our new Blockchain class! The first block is often referred to as the [Genesis Block](https://university.alchemy.com/course/ethereum/sc/5b3afd70d9f99763e5c4b4fe/stage/5b3ba85bd9f997b30859bb70?tab=details).

## 🏁 Your Goal: Add the Genesis Block

The `Blockchain.js` file contains the `Blockchain` class with a `chain` array. Let's add the **`Genesis Block`** to this array.

Create a `new Block` in the Blockchain constructor then add it to the `chain` array.
