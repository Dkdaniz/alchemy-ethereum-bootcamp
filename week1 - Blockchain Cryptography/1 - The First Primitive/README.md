# The First Primitive

## 🏁 Your Goal: Find the Color

Given a SHA256 hash, find the color input that would generate that hash. You can assume that all the hashes be generated only from colors provided in the COLORS array.

To take the hash of a color, first use utf8ToBytes to translate the string to bytes. Then, use sha256 to hash it.
When you want to compare two hashes, first use toHex to turn each hash from a Uint8Array to a string of hexadecimal characters.

So comparing two hashes would look like this:

```js
const a = "apple";
const b = "banana";

const aBytes = utf8ToBytes(a);
const bBytes = utf8ToBytes(b);

const aHash = sha256(aBytes);
const bHash = sha256(bBytes);

console.log(toHex(aHash) === toHex(aHash)); // true
console.log(toHex(aHash) === toHex(bHash)); // fals
```
